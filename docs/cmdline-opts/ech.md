# Configure Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) for use with the TLS session.

Possible values for <config> are:

- "false": do not attempt ECH

- "grease": send a GREASE'd ECH extension

- "true": attempt ECH if possible, but don't fail if not

- "hard": attempt ECH and fail if that's not possible

- "ecl:<b64val>": a base64 encoded ECHConfigList that will be used for ECH

- "pn:<name>": a name to use to over-ride the public_name field of an
   ECHConfigList

When multiple ``--ech`` options are supplied then the most-recent
value for true/false/hard/grease will be used, as will the most-recent
``ecl:<b64string>`` value, and ``pn:<name>`` value, if either of
those were provided.

ECH only works with TLS 1.3 and also requires using
DoH or providing an ECHConfigList on the command line.
